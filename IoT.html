                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">This project proposes the design of an architecture to create a Zigbee gateway for an IoT environment. The proposed
                                    design is intended to be flexible and to be able to adapt the infrastructure to meet specific requirements for a home
                                    automation network.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">The project is based on the Zigbee wireless protocol to create a network of sensors and actuators. This protocol is
                                    based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard developed to create battery-operated devices that require low power consumption. In
                                    addition to Zigbee, different types of technologies and tools are used that are widely used today for the development of
                                    projects related to smart devices.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">We maintain the development framework of this project in the context of a network of sensors and actuators that use
                                    Zigbee as a communication protocol. For this network, we need to obtain and process the reading data from these sensors
                                    and the commands sent to the actuator devices. The objective of this project is the design and development of an
                                    architecture with a gateway for a Zigbee network. The architecture allows this network to be accessible through the
                                    Internet and different dashboards are developed for the monitoring and control of the home automation network.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">Relying on different communication protocols, hardware and software, we create an IoT environment where we are able to define
                                    and control the logic of the operation and interaction of the different IoT devices.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">To achieve the objectives of this work, various technologies and tools were used, both hardware and software. The idea
                                    was to simulate basic functions of a Smart Home and achieve remote and secure access to these functions to show the
                                    approach of this project.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">Part of the proposed architecture consists of the deployment of a network of wireless sensors and actuators (WSAN) which
                                    are battery-operated and use Zigbee as the communication protocol. This network is made up of a humidity sensor, a
                                    contact sensor, a motion sensor, a light bulb and a switch. These are all end devices and it was not necessary to
                                    introduce any router devices into the Zigbee network. For the network coordinator we use a CC2531 USB dongle connected
                                    to a Raspberry Pi. This USB device was flashed with the ZigBee HA standard coordinator firmware and was used as the
                                    coordinator of the proposed Zigbee network.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">Another software we used was Zigbee2MQTT. This was the solution to be able to work with the zigbee data from the network
                                    through an application and to link everything to some cloud service to get remote access. Zigbee2MQTT acts as a bridge
                                    between Zigbee messages and MQTT messages. MQTT is an extremely lightweight publish-subscribe protocol that carries
                                    messages between devices and generally runs over a TCP/IP stack protocol. It is designed for connections to remote
                                    locations and is widely used in IoT. Zigbee2MQTT needs to connect as a client to an MQTT broker to send and receive
                                    messages. For this, we use Mosquitto, which is an open source MQTT message broker and it can handle all MQTT messages
                                    from clients that are connected to it.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">As a cloud service provider we use AWS and 3 key services were used: IoT Core, IAM and EC2. La forma en que conectamos
                                    la parte local de la arquitectura con AWS fue a trav√©s de un puente configurado entre Mosquitto y AWS IoT Core.
                                    Obviously, the application and the logic for the treatment of the devices through MQTT messages, it was necessary that
                                    they were deployed in a cloud service. For this we used Node-RED on a EC2 instance. Node-RED was the solution used to
                                    manage MQTT messages, to create the behavior flows of all the devices in the home automation network, and to create the
                                    monitoring and interaction dashboards for the Smart Home users. It is one of the most used tools in the development of
                                    IoT environments and is based on the development of flows to connect hardware devices, APIs and online services.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">The development of this work has allowed me to enter and get to know a little of a field that has caught my attention
                                    for a while and that I had not had the opportunity to work on. The Internet of Things is very interesting, it offers
                                    many opportunities for development and creation and it is a market that grows every day.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">As future work in this project, and having more learning time with Node-RED, not only we could improves and create more
                                    functionalities in the logic of the home automation network, but it would be interesting the possibility of exploring
                                    the integration of other wireless protocols such as those mentioned in previous chapters. This further opens the
                                    spectrum of devices from different manufacturers that could be used for certain functions within the architecture that
                                    has been proposed, which would increase its flexibility to be used to solve requirements in more scenarios.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">Another line that would be important to work on is regarding the part of architecture in the cloud environment. AWS
                                    provides tons of options to vary the work we have done. Although what we learned about AWS is quite useful and helped us
                                    to achieve the objectives of this project, it is feasible to think of solutions that would be given to a system that
                                    consumes many more resources, is larger and needs an infrastructure in high availability.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">All this information has helped me to grow more professionally and has opened up a little more the spectrum of work to
                                    which I would like to dedicate my time. An interesting conclusion that I have experienced is that the more ‚Äúthings‚Äù in
                                    our environment we are able to safely monitor and control, the more advantages we will have on a day-to-day basis.</p>
